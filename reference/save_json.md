# Save a model to a JSON file.

Serializes a `pptr` or `pprf` model to JSON format compatible with the
C++ CLI. The JSON includes the model structure, group labels, training
parameters, and optionally variable importance metrics.

## Usage

``` r
save_json(model, path, ...)

# S3 method for class 'ppmodel'
save_json(model, path, include_metrics = TRUE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  A `pptr` or `pprf` model (inheriting from `ppmodel`).

- path:

  File path to write the JSON to.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (currently unused).

- include_metrics:

  If `TRUE` (default), include variable importance and (for forests) OOB
  error in the output. Set to `FALSE` to save only the model structure
  and metadata.

## Value

Invisibly returns the file `path` that was written (a length-one
character string). Called for its side effect of serializing `model` to
a JSON file at `path`.
