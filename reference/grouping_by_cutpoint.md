# Cutpoint-based grouping strategy (regression).

Creates a grouping strategy for regression trees: observations are split
by the cutpoint in projected space, then each child's observations are
sorted by the continuous response and median-split into 2 new groups for
the next projection-pursuit step. This is the default grouping strategy
for regression.

## Usage

``` r
grouping_by_cutpoint()
```

## Value

A `grouping_strategy` object.
