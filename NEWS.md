# ppforest2 0.1.3

## New features

- R: `summary()` on a classification tree or forest now reports a per-class error rate alongside each confusion matrix, and prints the overall error rate above the matrix rather than below it. The headings, the quantities, and their precision now match the output of the `summarize` command, so an R summary and a command-line summary of the same model report the same numbers in the same order.

## Bug fixes

- CLI: a class with no observations in the data is rendered as `-` in the confusion matrix's error column instead of `nan%`. This happens when the model predicts a class that never appears as an actual label, for example when predicting on a subset of the data.

- CLI: `predict` now maps data-file labels through the model's training labels and keeps predictions in input row order. Previously the rows were re-sorted by label and label codes were compared by file position, so a data file listing classes in a different order than the training file reported inverted metrics and misaligned saved predictions. A label absent from training is now an error.
- CLI: `summarize --data` had the same label-space problem when recomputing metrics for a model saved with `--no-metrics`. It now maps labels through the model's training labels, validates the feature count of the data against the model, and reproduces the training row order so the recomputed out-of-bag metrics line up with the stored bootstrap sample indices.
- CLI: `train` and `evaluate` honor `--mode` when parsing the CSV — a regression response written as integers stays numeric instead of being label-encoded (previously the model silently trained on label codes).
- CLI: malformed CSVs are rejected instead of silently misread. Rows with a wrong column count are an error (they used to be silently dropped), a column mixing numeric and non-numeric cells (a stray `NA` or empty field) is an error naming the offending cell (it used to be silently integer-encoded), and non-finite cells (`nan`, `inf`) are rejected.
- CLI: `predict` validates the feature count of the data against the model, and `serve` validates the request's column count for models saved without feature names — both previously read out of bounds (a single `POST /predict` could crash the server).
- CLI: bad input that previously aborted with no usable message now produces a clean error: wrong-typed configuration-file values, out-of-range `--simulate` dimensions, wrong-typed benchmark scenario fields, and `--n-vars` exceeding the feature count.
- CLI: the `--config=path` form is honored (it used to be silently ignored; only `--config path` worked), and a configuration file whose top level is not a JSON object is rejected with a clear message.
- Core: the resolved thread count is clamped to at least 1 — `hardware_concurrency()` may report 0, and a non-positive OpenMP thread count is undefined behavior.

## Build

- `make tidy` now fails when clang-tidy reports findings or unused includes; previously it always succeeded.

## Documentation

- README: the CLI reference was synced with the actual binary — corrected flag names (`--size`, `--pp`, `--vars`, `--cutpoint`, `--stop`, `--binarize`, and friends), documented all six commands including `summarize`, fixed the benchmark output flags, and corrected the CMake requirement to 3.24.

# ppforest2 0.1.2

## CRAN

- Fixed a `-Wdeprecated-declarations` warning reported by CRAN's macOS/M1mac additional check (Apple clang 21, macOS 26 SDK). The newer libc++ deprecates `std::char_traits<unsigned char>`, which the vendored nlohmann/json instantiates through its binary output/stream adapters (`std::basic_string<std::uint8_t>` / `std::basic_ostream<std::uint8_t>`). ppforest2 does not use the nlohmann/json binary formats, so the vendored `json.hpp` is now bracketed with a `_Pragma` guard that suppresses the deprecation. `_Pragma` (unlike `#pragma`) is not flagged by `R CMD check`'s pragma check. The guard is applied by `make r-vendor-deps` (`scripts/vendor-guard-json.sh`).

# ppforest2 0.1.1

## Packaging and build

- R: The R package now compiles the C++ core directly through `Makevars` instead of CMake, with no network access or downloaded dependencies at install time. Eigen is provided by RcppEigen; nlohmann/json and pcg headers are vendored under `inst/include`. This makes the package installable on CRAN's offline build machines. (`fmt` and `csv-parser`, used only by the CLI, are no longer part of the R build.)
- R: Self-registering strategies are compiled directly into the shared object, removing the previous whole-archive linking workaround.
- R: Compiler flags for the direct build mirror the standalone C++ build — `EIGEN_NO_AUTOMATIC_RESIZING` on all platforms and `EIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE` on Windows.
- Core: Replaced C++20 designated initializers and fixed member-initialization order in `stats/GroupPartition` and `stats/Simulation` so the code compiles warning-free under a strict C++17 GCC (`-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`).
- Core: A compile-time `EIGEN_VERSION_AT_LEAST(3, 4, 0)` guard fails the build with a clear message if an incompatible Eigen is supplied (e.g. via RcppEigen).
- `make r-vendor-deps` re-vendors the committed json/pcg headers after a version bump in `core/Dependencies.cmake`.

## Documentation

- R: `DESCRIPTION` uses `Authors@R` and cites the projection-pursuit tree and forest references with DOIs.
- R: Examples for the parsnip and plot methods use `\donttest` with `requireNamespace()` guards instead of `\dontrun`, so they run under `--run-donttest` when the suggested packages are available.

## CRAN

- Added `cran-comments.md`. The package passes `R CMD check --as-cran` with no errors or warnings; remaining notes (new submission, cosmetic pragmas in the vendored nlohmann/json headers) are documented for the reviewer.

# ppforest2 0.1.0

## New features

- Core: Projection-pursuit oblique decision trees and random forests for classification, using LDA/PDA optimization.
- Core: Random uniform variable selection per split for forest diversity.
- Core: Three variable importance measures: permuted (VI1), projections (VI2), and weighted projections (VI3).
- Core: Out-of-bag error and confusion matrix for forests, with bootstrap sample indices persisted for recomputation. `oob_error` is `NA_real_` (R) / "not available" (CLI) when no observation has any out-of-bag tree.
- Core: Degenerate split detection when projection-pursuit cannot find a useful projection.
- Core: OpenMP multi-threaded forest training.
- Core: JSON serialization for trained models. Optional metrics fields use a uniform `null`-or-value representation so downstream tooling can distinguish "computed but empty" from other shapes without special-casing.
- Core: Cross-platform reproducibility — identical results for the same seed on Linux, macOS, and Windows, enforced by golden-file tests in CI.
- R: `pptr()` and `pprf()` with formula and matrix interfaces. Returned models carry an S3 class vector identifying both model type and mode (e.g. `c("pprf_classification", "pprf", "ppmodel")`).
- R: `predict()` returns group labels (`type = "class"`) or vote proportions (`type = "prob"`) for classification.
- R: `summary()` displays training and OOB confusion matrices.
- R: Lazy OOB accessors — `oob_error()`, `oob_predictions()`, `oob_samples()`, `bag_samples()`, `permuted_importance()`, `weighted_importance()` — compute from the training data stored on the model on first access and memoize in an environment cache, so training is fast and repeated access is free. `oob_predictions()` returns a factor with `NA` for rows with no OOB tree.
- R: Permuted variable importance may be negative; this is meaningful signal ("within noise") rather than a sentinel, so callers should rely on the ranking rather than clipping at zero. Weighted projection importance is non-negative by construction.
- R: Degenerate split warnings when projection-pursuit cannot separate groups.
- R: `save_json()` and `load_json()` for model persistence.
- R: tidymodels/parsnip integration: `pp_tree()` and `pp_rand_forest()` model specifications.
- R: ggplot2 visualizations — tree diagrams, variable importance plots, projection histograms, and decision boundary plots.
- R: Bundled classification datasets: crab, crabs, fishcatch, glass, image, leukemia, lymphoma, NCI60, olive, parkinson, and wine. (Use `datasets::iris` from base R for iris examples.)
- CLI: `train` fits a tree or forest from CSV and saves as JSON.
- CLI: `predict` applies a saved model to new data.
- CLI: `evaluate` runs train/test evaluation with smart convergence.
- CLI: `summarize` displays model configuration, data summary, and metrics from a saved model JSON. `--data` recomputes metrics from training data.
- CLI: `benchmark` runs multi-scenario performance benchmarks with baseline comparison.
- CLI: `serve` exposes a saved model over HTTP — `GET /` returns the model summary as JSON (or an HTML dashboard for browsers showing configuration, training metrics, and variable importance), `GET /health` is a liveness probe, and `POST /predict` accepts a feature CSV and returns predictions (JSON for API clients, an HTML predictions page for browsers, with a Download CSV button and confusion matrix when the request CSV includes a response column). Results are cached in-memory with shareable `?id=…` URLs; the dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

## Experimental features

Regression support is included but untested in production workloads. API surface and defaults may change in future releases.

- Core: Regression training via a `ByCutpoint` grouping strategy that quantile-slices the continuous response, a `MeanResponse` leaf, and `MinSize` / `MinVariance` / `CompositeStop` (`stop::any`) stop rules.
- Core: Regression metrics — MSE, MAE, and R² — computed for training and out-of-bag predictions. Forest OOB error is reported as MSE.
- R: Regression auto-detected when `y` is numeric (not a factor). `predict()` returns a numeric vector (`type = "response"`).
- R: Regression strategy wrappers: `grouping_by_cutpoint()`, `leaf_mean_response()`, `stop_min_size()`, `stop_min_variance()`, `stop_any()`.
- R: `summary()` displays MSE / MAE / R² for regression models. `oob_predictions()` returns a numeric vector with `NA_real_` for rows with no OOB tree.
- R: `save_json()` / `load_json()` preserve regression mode; parsnip `pp_tree()` / `pp_rand_forest()` accept `mode = "regression"`.
- CLI: `--mode classification|regression` selects the training mode; regression reads the last CSV column as the continuous response. `predict` returns numeric predictions and MSE/MAE/R²; `evaluate` reports MSE for regression.
- R: Bundled regression dataset `california_housing` (20,433 × 9, predict `median_house_value`). For smaller regression examples use `datasets::mtcars` from base R.
